# **entity-and-context**
I have created a basic 
JPA project with Hibernate https://hibernate.org/ as tool for ORM and used Mysql database
for storing the data with basic Student Schema.

In this project, i have created few objects and using EntityManager add the objects into the context
and persist them in the database.
